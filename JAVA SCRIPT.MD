### HISTORY OF JS
### Origins and Creation

- *Inventor*: JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape Communications Corporation.
- *Date*: It was developed over a period of ten days in May 1995.

### Development Timeline

1. *1995*:
   - *Creation*: Brendan Eich developed JavaScript under the name "Mocha," which was later renamed to "LiveScript" and finally "JavaScript."
   *Netscape  Navigator 2.0*: JavaScript was first integrated into Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995.

2. *1996*:
   - *Microsoft's Response*: Microsoft created a clone of JavaScript called JScript, which was included in Internet Explorer 3.0.
   - *Standardization*: Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International for standardization.

3. *1997*:
   - *ECMAScript*: The first version of the ECMAScript standard (ECMA-262) was published. ECMAScript is the standardized specification of JavaScript.

4. *1999*:
   - *ES3*: The third edition of ECMAScript was released, which included significant improvements and became widely adopted.

5. *2005*:
   - *AJAX*: The introduction of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allowed web pages to update asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This made JavaScript even more essential for web development.

6. *2009*:
   - *ES5*: The fifth edition of ECMAScript was released, adding new features like "strict mode," JSON support, and more.

7. *2015*:
   - *ES6/ECMAScript 2015*: A major update known as ECMAScript 2015 (or ES6) was released. This update included many new features like classes, modules, arrow functions, and more, significantly modernizing the language.

8. *2016-Present*:
   - *Annual Updates*: ECMAScript started following an annual release cycle, with new features and improvements being added every year.

### Key Features and Impact

- *Interactivity*: JavaScript enabled dynamic content and interactivity on web pages, which was not possible with just HTML and CSS.
- *Ubiquity*: Today, JavaScript is ubiquitous on the web, supported by all modern browsers and used by millions of websites.
- *Ecosystem*: The JavaScript ecosystem includes a vast number of libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, which facilitate web development.
- *Server-Side JavaScript*: With the advent of Node.js in 2009, JavaScript also became a prominent server-side language, allowing developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development.
-  JavaScript is a light-weight language.
- JavaScript is a case sensitive and object-based scripting language.
- JavaScript is an untyped language, it means we don't need to define the data type of the variables.
Gives the user more control over the browser.
Every statement in Javascript terminates with a semicolon (;).
- Most of the Javascript control statements syntax is the same as the syntax of control statements in C and Java language.
- JavaScript has built-in functions to determine the date and time.


more about server side

# Advantages of javascript
- Make the HTML page more interactive.   
-JavaScript is very easy to learn and understand.
- JavaScript increases the performance of websites and web applications by raising the length of code 
- Execute code on events.   
- Get/Set the Cookies, data, and output messages.    
- All common browsers support JavaScript. So it is very popular.
- JavaScript is client-side, so it reduces the demand on servers overall.
# Disadvantages of JavaScript
- Can't help to Read/ Write hard disk data, copy files and call other Programmes.
- This will only work on the one tab of the browser, it can't affect another tab.
- JavaScript supports all the browsers, so sometimes different browsers interpret JavaScript code differently.
- JavaScript does not support multiple inheritances.
- A single code error will stop all JavaScript code from running on the website.

# java vs javascript


Basic Background
 
Web development is all about communication and data exchange. This communication takes place via two parties over the HTTP protocol.
 
These parties are: 
 
Client side and Server Side
 
Server
 
The Server is responsible for serving the web pages depending on the client/end-user requirement. It can be either static or dynamic.
 
Client
 
A client is a party that requests pages from the server and displays them to the end-user. In general a client program is a web browser.
 
Example | Working
 
We can explain this entire mechanism using the following:
The user opens his web browser (client)
The user starts browsing
 
(for example http://c-sharpcorner.com)
 
The client forwards this request to the server, for accessing their web page.
The server then acknowledges the request and replies back to the client program.
 
(An access link to that web page)
 
The client then receives the page source and renders it.
 
(Into a viewable/under a stable website)
 
Now the user types into the search bar
The client then submits data to the server
The server processes the data and replies back with a related search result
The client again renders it back for the user's view
The user gets access to the requested link.
Server-side Programming
 
Server-side programming can be explained as:
 
It is the general name for the kind of program that runs directly on the server.
 
Or we can say that server-side programming must deal with dynamic content. It runs on the server. Most web pages are not static since they deal with searching databases.
 
Server-side Uses
- It processes the user input
- Displays the requested pages
- Structure of web applications
- Interaction with servers/storages
- Interaction with databases
- Querying the database
- Encoding of data into HTML
- Operations over databases like delete, update.
- Server-side Languages Example
 
There are several languages that can be used for server-side programming:
PHP
ASP.NET (C# OR Visual Basic)
C++
Java and JSP
Python
Ruby on Rails and so on.

Server-side Example
```c# 
// This is a sample C# code.    
using System;    
// namespace    
class ServerSide    
{    
    public static void Main()    
    {    
        System.Console.WriteLine(“Hello C# Corner”);    
        // printing a line    
    }    
}  
```
# Client-side Programming
 
Similarly to server-side programming, client-side programming is also the name of the entire program that runs on the client. 
 
Or we can say that client-side programming mostly deals with the user interface with which the user interacts in the web. It is mostly a browser, in the user's machine, that runs the code and is mainly done in any scripting language like JavaScript (or we can use Flash instead of JavaScript or VNScript).
 
* Client-side Uses
- Makes interactive web pages
- Make stuff work dynamically
- Interact with temporary storage
- Works as an interface between user and server
- Sends requests to the server
- Retrieval of data from Server
- Interact with local storage
- Provides remote access for client-server program

* Client-side Languages Example
There are many client-side scripting languages too.
JavaScript
VBScript
HTML (Structure)
CSS (Designing)
AJAX
jQuery etc.
(Some other languages also can be used on the basis of the modeling/designing /graphics/animations and for extra functionalities.)
 
Client-side Example
// sample HTML code  
```html
<html>  
<head>  
    <title>Client Side </title>  
</head>  
<body>  
    <h1>  
        Hello C# Corner  
    </h1>  
</body>  
</html> 
```
# Object-based Scripting language JavaScript
 
JavaScript is an object-based scripting language. But JavaScript doesn't support all OOP functions. In JavaScript, we use object, class, encapsulation, aggregation, and polymorphism -- the OOPs concept. JavaScript only supports single inheritance; it does not support multiple inheritances.

### Fun Fact

- *Naming Confusion*: Despite its name, JavaScript has little to do with the Java programming language. The name was chosen as a marketing strategy to ride on the popularity of Java at the time.

### Summary

* JavaScript, created by Brendan Eich in 1995, has grown from a simple scripting language for web browsers into a powerful, versatile language used for both client-side and server-side development. Its evolution through ECMAScript standards has ensured its continued relevance and advancement in the ever-changing landscape of web development.


 JavaScript from the basics and move to advanced topics step by step. 1 to 6 is basic

1. Introduction to JavaScript
2. Variables and Data Types
3. Operators
4. Control Structures
5. Functions
6. Arrays and Objects
7. DOM Manipulation
8. Events
9. Asynchronous JavaScript
10. Advanced Topics

### 1. Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development to create interactive effects within web browsers. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.

### PRINT STATMENT
```JS
Console.log(“pallavi”); //print message 
alert('Hello, world!');// hello,world!
 document.write(5 + 6); //11
```
- for the jointing file in html
```HTML
<script src=“file.exe”></script>
```

#### Getting Started

To write JavaScript, you need a text editor (like VS Code or Sublime Text) and a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).

Here's a basic example of JavaScript:

*HTML File (index.html)*

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
   <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="greeting">Hello!</h1>
<script language= "java script">
   /*  
    var a = 25;  
    var b = 75;  
    var c = a + b; //addition of a and b is store in c variable  
    document.write("Addition of " + a + " and " + b + " is " + c);  
    */    
    function Print() {    
        document.write("Example of Multi-line Comments in JavaScript");    
    }    
    Print();// output : example of multi-line comments in javascript    
    // this is single line comment
<script>    
</body>
</html>
```

*JavaScript File (script.js)*

```javascript
document.getElementById('greeting').innerText = 'Hello, World!';
```

### 2. Variables and Data Types

### Variables

* Variables are containers for storing data values. JavaScript uses keywords let, const, and var to declare variables.

- let: Used to declare a variable that can be reassigned.
- const: Used to declare a constant variable that cannot be reassigned.
- var: The old way to declare variables (use let or const instead).

>Keyword	Scope - 	Redeclaration & Reassignment - 	Hoisting
* var -	Global, Local	yes & yes	yes, with default value
* let	- Global, Local, Block	no & yes	yes, without default value
* const - Global, Local, Block	no & no	yes, without default value
### key remember points 
-  Btana padta nhi h kya store kia number value java script is dynamically typed
- java script is case sensitive
- letter digit,_,is allowed (  space is not allowed)
- reserve words not allowed 
- Camel case ~aBc 
- block scope is {inside}
- same text written in the quotes is in the same as output because it is string ("0").
- Var = re declared ,global scope
- Let = not re declare, to be update ,block scope
- Const = not re declare, not update ,block scope
- string + se number =stringnumber
```js
let Age = 25;
let name = "pallavi";
document.write(name + Age)

```
* for the variable print
```js
console.log(variableName);// print the variable
```

*Example:*

```javascript
let age = 25;
const name = "John";
var isStudent = true;
```

#### Data Types

JavaScript has several data types:
- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Object
- Undefined
- Null
- Symbol (ES6)
- BigInt (ES2020)

*Example:*

```javascript
let age = 25; // Number
let name = "John"; // String - a line of words
let isStudent = true; // Boolean - true /false
let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 25
     }; // Object
let undef; // Undefined
let empty = null; // Null
```
#### * String methods

- concatenation
```js
const name = 'john';
const age = 30;

console.log('My name is '+ name + ' i am '+age + ' years old' )
```
- length ,uppercase,lowercase,substring,split
```js

const s = 'hello world';

console.log(s.length);//10
console.log(s.toUpperCase());//HELLO WORLD
console.log(s.toLowerCase());//hello world
console.log(s.substring(0,5));//Hello
console.log(s.split(''));//(12)('h' 'o')
```

### 3. Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

- Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %,** , 5**2(exponent-ion),++(increment),--(decrement),
- Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=
- Comparison Operators: ==(equal to), ===(equal to type), !=(Not equal to), !==(not equal to type), >, <, >=, <=
- Logical Operators: &&(and), ||(or), !(not)

*Example:*
Arithmetic Operators
```javascript
console.log("Arithmetic Operators:");
let a = 10, b = 3;
console.log(a,b);
//  +
console.log(a + b);//13
// - 
console.log(a - b);//7
// *
console.log(a * b);//30
// /
console.log(a / b);//3.333.....
// % modulus
console.log(a % b);//1
// ** exponentiation
console.log(a ** b);//1000
// ++ pre increment (++x)
console.log(a++);//10
// ++ post increment (x++)
console.log(++b);//4
// -- pre decrement (--x)
console.log(a--);//11
// -- post decrement (x--)
console.log(--b);//3

```

// Assignment Operators:
```js
console.log("Assignment Operators:");
// =
let x = 5;
// += 
x += 2;//x = x + 2
console.log(x);//7
// -=
x -= 1;// x = x - 1
console.log(x);//6
// *=
x *= 3;// x = x * 3
console.log(x);//18
// /=
x /= 2;// x = x / 2
console.log(x);//9
// %=
x %= 4;// x = x % 4
console.log(x);//1
// ** exponentiation
x **= 3;// x = x **3 = 1^3
console.log(x);//1
```

// Logical Operators:
```js
console.log("Logical Operators:");
let isAdult = true, hasID = false;
console.log(isAdult,hasID);

// && (AND) 
console.log(isAdult && hasID);// false 
// || (OR) 
console.log(isAdult || hasID);//true
// ! (NOT) 
console.log(!isAdult);// false
```
-  Comparison Operators:
```js
console.log("Logical Operators:");
let a = 7, b = 4;
console.log(a,b);
//  =
console.log(a = b);//false
//  !=
console.log(a != b);//true
//  === strict equal to
console.log(a === b);//false 
//  !== strict NOT equal to
console.log(a !== b);//true
//  >
console.log(a > b);//true
//  <
console.log(a < b);//false
//  >=
console.log(a >= b);//true
//  <=
console.log(a <= b);//false
```



```js
let isEqual = (10 == 10); // true
let isStrictEqual g  = (10 === '10'); // false
let isNotEqual = (10 != 5); // true
let isGreaterThan = (10 > 5); // true
```

### 4. Control Structures

Control structures are used to control the flow of execution in a program.
- break 
- continue

#### if-else
```JS
let hour = 10;

if (hour < 12) {
    console.log("Good morning!");
} else {
    console.log("Good afternoon!");
}
```
#### else if
```js
let marks = 75;
if(marks>=90)
console.log("Grade A");
 else if(marks >= "Grade B");
console.log("grade B");
 else
console.log("Grade C");
```
#### nested if
```js
let student = { age: 20,city:"ahemdabad"};

if(student.age > 18){
    if (student.city === "AHEMDABAD"){
        console.log("Local Eligible Student";)
    }
}
```
#### switch

```javascript
let day = 2;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        console.log("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        console.log("Tuesday");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Unknown day");
}
```

## Loops

* *for Loop:* ittration is defined  
- pattern print raw and col
- ***** **** *** ** *
```js
for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++){


}
```

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}

```
* *while Loop:* 

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}//0 1 2 3 4 5

let battery =(Math.())

```
* *do while* 
```js
let a = 5
do{
    console.log("do",a);
    a--;}
while(a > 0);// do 1 2 3 4 5
```
* *for in loop*
```js
//keys
for
(let k in {p:1,q:2})
console.log("in",k);//in p // in q

```

* for of loop
```js
//values
const arr2 = [10,20,30];
for(
    let x of arr2)
    console.log
("of",x);//of 10 of 20 of 30

```
### 5.  Functions

Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task.
- function group of logics

#### Declaring a Function

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name;
}

let greeting = greet("Alice"); // "Hello, Alice"
```

#### Function Expressions

```javascript
let greet = function(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name;
};

let greeting = greet("Alice"); // "Hello, Alice"
```

#### Arrow Functions (ES6)

```javascript
let greet = (name) => {
    return "Hello, " + name;
};

let greeting = greet("Alice"); // "Hello, Alice"

// ex 2
const multiply = (a1,a2) => {
    console.log(a1 * a2 )
}
multiply(5,2) // 10

```

- callback fuction
```JS
fuction sum(a,b){
    return console.log( a + b);
}
fuction student(callback){
    callback(1,2);
}

student(sum);
```

### 6. Arrays and Objects

#### Arrays

Arrays are lists of items.


```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(fruits[1]); // "banana"

// loop in through array
let array = [ 1,2,3,4,5]
for(let i=0 i<array.lenghth -1; i++)
{ 
    console.log(array[i]);
}// 1 2 3 4 
```

- Array methods
```js
let fruits =['apple', 'orange','banana'];

fruits[3]='grapes';

fruits.unshift('strawberries');//add [stra,app,orang,banana]
arr.shift();//remove first 
fruits.pop();//remove last
fruits.push('mangoes');//add in arr last

console.log(fruits , arr.length);
```

#### Objects

Objects are collections of key-value pairs.
Every object has its own properties and methods. Properties define the characteristics of an object
* object, {} {key property : value,kp:value };
- index and [idx]notation
- Null ~value = nothing (absence of object)
- . Notation variable.key properties change or update 
Undefined ~ there is something value 

```javascript
/*objectName.propName 
         or 
objectName[“property”]
*/
let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    isStudent: false
};

console.log(person.name); // "John"
```
```js
var employee = new Object(); //Creating an object    
 
    //Assigning properties to an object 'employee'    
    employee.name = "Jeetendra";    
    employee.city = "Pune";    
    
    //Assigning method to an object 'employee'    
    employee.info = function () {    
        document.write("Name : " + this.name + " City : " + this.city);    
    }    
    
    //calling the method    
    employee.info(); 
    
```
- delete the object
- delete objectName.propName; 
```js
var employee = new Object(); //Creating an object    
    
    //Assigning properties to an object 'employee'    
    employee.name = "Jeetendra";    
    employee.city = "Pune";    
    employee.id = "1072";    
    employee.company = "GNS";    
    
    //deleting properties of object 'employee'    
    delete employee.company;    
    
    //Assigning method to an object 'employee'    
    employee.info = function () {    
        document.write("Name : " + this.name + " City : " + this.city);    
        document.write("ID : " + this.id + " Company : " + this.company);    
    }    
    //calling the method    
    employee.info();    
    //Output: Name : Jeetendra City : PuneID : 1072 Company : undefined

```
example
```js
let obj ={ a:1, b:2};
obj.c = 3;//add 3
delete.obj.b;//remove b
console.log(obj);//{ a: 1, b: 2 }
console.log(Object.keys(obj));//[ 'a', 'b' ]
console.log(Object.values(obj));//[ 1, 2 ]
```
- Built-in Objects
### METHODS 
There are some built-in objects of JavaScript that offer more advanced operations like the following: 
* Math Objects
* Date Objects
* String Objects
* Math Objects
 
It provides methods for many mathematical calculations like: abs(), log(), pow(), sqrt() and so on.
 
Syntax
Math.methodName(value);   

```js
console.log(Math.floor(3.8)); // 3
console.log(Math.ceil(3.2));  // 4
console.log(Math.round(3.5)); // 4
console.log(Math.random());   // random 0 <= r < 1
// random integer 0..9
const r = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
console.log(r);
```

Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>    
<html>    
<title>JavaScript Objects</title>    
<head></head>    
<body>    
<script language="javascript">    
    //Math object example    
    var n = 4;    
    var res = Math.sqrt(n);    
    document.write("Square of " + n + " is " + res);    
</script>    
</body>    
</html>   
```
Output: Square of 4 is 2
 
Date Objects
 
It provides the methods to get the current day, month, and year.
 
Syntax
dateObject.methodName();   
Example
```js  
    //Date object example    
    var date = new Date();    
    var res = date.getFullYear();    
    document.write("Current Date is " + date + " and Year is " + res);
    
```    
Output: Current Date is Thu Nov 27, 2014, 23:22:37 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time) and Year is 2014
 ```js
 const d = new Date(); // now
console.log(d.toString());
console.log(d.getFullYear()); // e.g. 2025
console.log(d.getMonth());// 0-based month (0 = Jan)
console.log(d.getDate());// day of month
 ```


### String Objects
 
It provides the methods and properties for string manipulation and formatting. 
```js
let userName = "pallavi chavda";
let phoneNo = "884906143";
//string length
console.log(userName.length);
//string alphabet on line 
console.log(userName.charAt(2));
//index no of line of str
console.log(userName.lastIndexOf("a"));
//Removes whitespace from the beginning (left) of a string. trimLeft() is an alias for this method.
//Removes whitespace from the end (right) of a string. trimRight() is an alias for this method.
userName = userName.trim();
console.log(userName.toUpperCase());
console.log(userName.toLowerCase());
//console.log(userName);
```  
* Syntax
   stringName.methodName();   
Example    
```js
    Let str =“apna collage”;
    //Str.length TO FIND LENGTH OF THE STRING
    Str[6],str[1]
    //String object example    
    var str = "C# Corner";    
    var bld = str.bold();    
    document.write("First String is " + str + " After formatting " + bld);
```   
Output: First String is C# Corner After formatting C# Corner.

### 7. DOM Manipulation

The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the page's structure, and JavaScript can be used to manipulate it.

```javascript
let element = document.getElementById("myElement");
element.innerHTML = "Hello, World!";
```
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <p id = "p1">Hi </p>
    <button id ="btn">Click</button>

 <script>
    const el = document.getElementById("p1");
    console.log(el.textContent);//Hi

    el.textContent = "Hello DOM";
    el.innerHTML = "<b>Bold</b>";

    const btn = document.getElementById("btn");
    btn.addEventListener("click",() =>{
        alert("Button clicked!");
    });

 </script>
 </body>
 </html>   
<!-- Bold 
 click button
 pop up alert -->
```

### 8. Events

JavaScript can detect events like clicks, mouse movements, and key presses.

```javascript
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Button clicked!");
});
```

### 9. Asynchronous JavaScript

Asynchronous JavaScript allows you to handle operations that take time, like fetching data from an API.

#### Promises

```javascript
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), 1000);
});

promise.then(result => console.log(result)); // "Done!"
```

#### Async/Await / JSON

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    let data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
}

fetchData();
```
- JSON - JSON.strinify-object to sting;
JSON.parse- string to object
- use -useful for network or local storage 
```js
const obj = { a:1, b:2 };
const str = JSON.stringify(obj);
console.log(str);            // '{"a":1,"b":2}'

const parsed = JSON.parse(str);
console.log(parsed.a);       // 1
```

### 10. Advanced Topics

#### ES6 Features

*let and const:*
```javascript
let x = 10;
const y = 20;
```

*Arrow Functions:*

```javascript
let add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

*Template Literals:*

```javascript
let name = "John";
let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`; // "Hello, John!"
```

#### Modules


// module.js
export const PI = 3.14;

// main.js
import { PI } from './module.js';
console.log(PI); // 3.14

#### **Part 1: Basics (1–40)**

1. **What is JavaScript?**  
   - **Answer**: JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language commonly used for creating interactive web applications.  
   - **Explanation**: It allows developers to implement dynamic content such as slideshows, form validations, and interactive maps.  

---

2. **How do you declare a variable in JavaScript?**  
   - **Answer**: Using `var`, `let`, or `const`.  
   - **Explanation**:  
     - `var` is function-scoped.  
     - `let` is block-scoped and can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.  
     - `const` is block-scoped and cannot be updated or redeclared.

---

3. **What is the difference between `==` and `===`?**  
   - **Answer**: `==` compares values after type coercion, while `===` compares both value and type.  
   - **Explanation**:  
     ```javascript
     console.log(5 == "5");  // true (type coercion occurs)
     console.log(5 === "5"); // false (strict comparison)
     ```

---

4. **What are the data types in JavaScript?**  
   - **Answer**: Primitive: `String`, `Number`, `BigInt`, `Boolean`, `undefined`, `Symbol`, and `null`. Non-primitive: `Object`.  

---

5. **What is the output of `typeof null`?**  
   - **Answer**: `object`.  
   - **Explanation**: This is a bug in JavaScript that dates back to its early implementation.

---

6. **What is the difference between `let` and `const`?**  
   - **Answer**:  
     - `let`: Can be reassigned but not redeclared.  
     - `const`: Cannot be reassigned or redeclared.  
   - **Explanation**:  
     ```javascript
     let x = 10;
     x = 20;  // Valid

     const y = 30;
     y = 40;  // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
     ```

---

7. **What is the purpose of `use strict`?**  
   - **Answer**: To enforce stricter parsing and error handling.  
   - **Explanation**: It prevents the use of undeclared variables and disallows duplicate parameter names.

---

8. **What are JavaScript closures?**  
   - **Answer**: A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when executed outside its original scope.  
   - **Explanation**:  
     ```javascript
     function outer() {
         let count = 0;
         return function inner() {
             count++;
             return count;
         };
     }

     const counter = outer();
     console.log(counter()); // 1
     console.log(counter()); // 2
     ```

#### **Advanced JavaScript Concepts (41–100)**

---

41. **What is the difference between `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`?**  
   - **Answer**:  
     - `call()`: Invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually.  
     - `apply()`: Similar to `call()` but takes arguments as an array.  
     - `bind()`: Returns a new function with the specified `this` value and arguments.  
   - **Explanation**:  
     ```javascript
     const obj = { x: 10 };
     function add(y) {
         return this.x + y;
     }

     console.log(add.call(obj, 5));  // 15
     console.log(add.apply(obj, [5])); // 15
     const bound = add.bind(obj);
     console.log(bound(5));  // 15
     ```

---

42. **What is event delegation in JavaScript?**  
   - **Answer**: Event delegation is a technique where a parent element handles events for its child elements using event bubbling.  
   - **Explanation**:  
     ```javascript
     document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
         if (event.target && event.target.matches("button.classname")) {
             console.log("Button clicked!");
         }
     });
     ```

---

50. **What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` scoping?**  
   - **Answer**:  
     - `var`: Function-scoped.  
     - `let` and `const`: Block-scoped.  

---

70. **Explain the concept of Promises.**  
   - **Answer**: Promises represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.  
   - **Explanation**:  
     ```javascript
     const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         setTimeout(() => resolve("Success!"), 1000);
     });

     promise.then(result => console.log(result));
     ```

---

100. **Explain async/await in JavaScript.**  
   - **Answer**: Syntactic sugar over Promises for handling asynchronous operations.  
   - **Explanation**:  
     ```javascript
     async function fetchData() {
         try {
             const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
             const data = await response.json();
             console.log(data);
         } catch (error) {
             console.error(error);
         }

  ```

---

### **104. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?**  
- **Answer**:  
  - **Shallow copy**: Copies only the first layer of an object.  
  - **Deep copy**: Copies all nested layers.  
- **Explanation**:  
  ```javascript
  const obj = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
  const shallow = { ...obj };
  const deep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));

  shallow.b.c = 42;
  console.log(obj.b.c); // Output: 42 (shallow copy affected original)

  deep.b.c = 10;
  console.log(obj.b.c); // Output: 42 (deep copy doesn't affect original)
  ```

---

### **105. What are the different types of errors in JavaScript?**

      const data = await response.json();
      console.log(data);
  }
  ```

---

### **108. What is hoisting in JavaScript?**  
- **Answer**: Variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during compilation.  
- **Explanation**:  
  ```javascript
  console.log(a); // Undefined
  var a = 5;

  greet(); // Works due to hoisting
  function greet() {
      console.log("Hello!");
  }
  ```

---

### **109. Explain the concept of `prototype` in JavaScript.**  
- **Answer**: The `prototype` is an object that allows inheritance of methods and properties between objects.  
- **Explanation**:  
  ```javascript
  function Person(name) {
      this.name = name;
  }

  Person.prototype.greet = function () {
      return `Hello, ${this.name}!`;

           else if (this.cache.size === this.size) this.cache.delete(this.cache.keys().next().value);
           this.cache.set(key, value);
       }
   }

   const cache = new LRUCache(2);
   cache.put(1, 1);
   cache.put(2, 2);
   console.log(cache.get(1)); // Output: 1
   cache.put(3, 3);
   console.log(cache.get(2)); // Output: -1
   ```
   **Explanation**: Implements a least recently used (LRU) cache using `Map`.

17. **Event Emitter**
   ```javascript
   class EventEmitter {
       constructor() {
           this.events = {};
       }

       on(event, listener) {
           if (!this.events[event]) this.events[event] = [];
           this.events[event].push(listener);
       }

       emit(event, ...args) {
           if (this.events[event]) this.events[event].forEach(listener => listener(...args));
       }
   }

   const emitter = new EventEmitter();
   emitter.on('greet', name => console.log(`Hello, ${name}`));
   emitter.emit('greet', 'Alice'); // Output: Hello, Alice
   ```

# MY NOTES


```Js
if ( ₹=$){$=£;}
If(₹=“$”){$=“rich”;}else{₹=“£”;}
If(){;}else if(){;}else{;}
```
**Ternary operator(?)~ A=>18?”adult”:”not adult”;
Let name =age>10 ?,’pallavi’:’kitty’;
``` HTML
Const component =()=>{ return age>10?<div>pallavi</div>:<div>kitty</div>;
```
MDN docs ~documents mozilla mdn refrence extension 
Switch case  statement  break;
Promt as same as alert and take  input
Loops
``` JS
 for( let i=1 ,i <= 5;i++}{console.log(“);}

While(i<=5){  console.log(””)  ;}

Do {console.log(“i”,=1); i ++;}while(i<=5);

For ( of ){ work}

For (let key in obj var) {work }

For (let num =0; num <=100; num++){
If ( num%2 ===0)
Console.log(“num” = ,num);
}
}
```
€
€template literal ‘ ${variable}‘ ~ single string ~${9-1-2-4}
€string methods
Strings are immutable in JS is not replaceable 
New string creation and operation work
Str.toUpperCase()
Str.toLowerCase()
Str.trim() //remove whitespace from start and end
Str.slice(start,end?)// returns part of string ,ending value excluded 
Str.concat(str2)
Str.replace(search Val,newVal)
Str.charAt(idx) // index of characters

Array
Array is mutable replaceable 
Let marks =[1,2,3,4,5];
Arr[4] =8
Const names2=[…names,”kc”];
Loops in array 
For loop : < length
For (let idx=0; idx <arr.length ; idx++){
Console .log(arr[idx]);
for of
For (let arr of array){console.log(arr);}
Arrays method
Push()~ add to end
Pop()~delete from end & return
toString(): converts array-to  string
Concat() joins multiple array & returns result
Unshift():add to start
Shift(): delete from start & return
Slice() returns a piece of the array
Splice() change orignal array (add remove,replace)
Arr.splice[] delete to the idx and add that numbers and another no

€fuctions
Function function name ( para 1,para 2){
// work} 
parameters input var ~comman value Like local var block scope of function 
Arguments ~ function call value€ to   redundancies = remove repetition
return 0; end of the code 


Call
functionName( );

Type of function 
Function square (number){return number *number;} console.log(square (2));

Names.Map (()=>{console.log(name)})
Filter  
Async
Await
Fetch

Set of statements collected or perform selected the task

Aero function 
```js
<button  onClick ={() =>{ console.log(‘hello ‘);}}></button>

```
Components







# practicals or 

   swap numbers like 
   a = 2
   b = 4



   ### add to number 


   ```js 
   const num1 = Number(prompt("please Enter First Number"))
```

```js
var actors = ["Felicia", "Nathan", "Neil"];
actors[actors.length - 1];

OUTPUT
"Neil"

## Bitwise Operators
## copyWithin() array object method
> copyWithin(target)
```js
console.log([1, 2, 3, 4, 5].copyWithin(3));
// index 3 is changed with index 1 and next value follow by index 0 till length is not fullfill.
//Output: 1,2,3,1,2
```
>copyWithin(target,start)
```js
console.log([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9,10].copyWithin(1,3));
// index 1 is changed with index 3 and next value follow by index 3 till length is not fullfill.
// legth - start to end length == what number can be save in array list from decending order.
//Output : 1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,9,10

```
>copyWithin(target,start,end)
```js
console.log([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9,10].copyWithin(1,3,6));
// index 1 is changed with index 3 and next value follow by index 3 till length is not fullfill.
// legth - start to end length == what number can be save in array list from decending order.
//Output : 1, 4, 5, 6,  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
